# AirlineCheckInSimulator
A Java program simulating an airline check-in process.

## Rules

There are two kinds of passenger, first-class passenger and normal passenger. 

Correspondingly, there are two kinds of check-in desks. 

First-class check-in desks generally operate faster than normal passenger check-in desks.

If there exists first-class passenger, first-class check-in desks will always serve them first. If there is no first-class passenger, first-class check-in desks also serve normal passengers.

Normal check-in desks never serve first-class passengers.
